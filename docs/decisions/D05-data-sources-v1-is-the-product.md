## D5 — Data sources: /v1 is the product; the internal API is optional garnish (2026-11-04, plan §3.5)

The documented `GET /v1/alliances/{id}` is the only required source; it refreshes on read. The site's internal API is used read-only for the ranks board (cross-check, 0 quota) and as a per-alliance fallback that accepts only `live: true` rosters, recorded as `source = internal`. The site's refresh endpoint is closed to outsiders on purpose; we never call it or imitate the site's headers. No number in a delta depends on an undocumented endpoint. One API key, no pooling.
