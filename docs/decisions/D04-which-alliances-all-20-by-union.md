## D4 — Which alliances: all 20, by union_id, fixed per event (2026-11-04, plan §3.4)

`config/alliances.ts` lists 20 alliances by `union_id`, because tags are case-sensitive, collide and change. The BEFORE run copies the list onto the event, and the AFTER run uses that copy, so a config change mid-Saturday can't make the phases incomparable. Quota rule: a run starts only if `remaining >= 2 × (alliances + 5)` (`lib/budget.ts: requiredQuota`).
